## SubTracker API
SubTracker is a high-performance, DevSecOps-focused Subscription Management Backend built with Node.js and Express. It provides a centralized platform for users to track recurring expenses, manage payment cycles, and receive automated reminders while maintaining a high security posture through automated scanning and real-time protection.

#### CI/CD Workflows:
- ci-ui.yml:
  - SAST/SCA: Static code scanning with Checkov and Snyk.
  - Container Security: Image layer scanning with Trivy.
  - DAST: Dynamic analysis with OWASP ZAP.
- ci-api.yml:
  - Static scan code with checkov(SAST, SCA)
  - Build Image
  - Container security with Trivy (SCA, Image layes scan)
  - Dynamic scan with OWASP ZAP (DAST)
  - Push Image to DockerHub

- security.yml:
  - Scans for security flaws in all the workflows files ".yml" (SAST)

 ## Vulnerability Management
I actively monitor dependencies and patch issues immediately.

Recent Patch: Upgraded express to 4.22.0 to resolve a High-severity Allocation of Resources Without Limits (DoS) vulnerability in the qs dependency detected by Snyk.

## 🛡️ Security Policy
This API uses Arcjet to provide:

-  Rate Limiting: Protects against brute-force attacks.
  
-  Bot Detection: Blocks malicious bots while allowing search engines.
  
-  Shield: Real-time protection against common web vulnerabilities.


## Key Features
🔐 Robust Authentication: JWT-based auth with secure cookie support and password hashing.

🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security:

-  Arcjet Integration: Bot detection, rate limiting, and SQL/XSS protection.
  
-  Ownership Middleware: Strict data isolation—users can only access their own subscriptions.
  
-  ⚙️ Automated Workflows: Powered by Upstash to send reminders 7, 5, 2, and 1 days before a subscription renews.
  
  -  📊 Subscription Tracking: Support for various frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), categories, and     currencies.
  
-  ⚡ Performance & Logging: High-performance structured logging using Pino with log rotation and redaction for sensitive data.
  
-  📦 Transactional Integrity: Uses MongoDB Sessions/Transactions during sign-up to ensure data consistency.
